ULTRAKILL is a fast-paced, retro-style first-person shooter developed by Arsi "Hakita" Patala and published by New Blood Interactive. Inspired by classics like DOOM, Quake, and Devil May Cry, the game combines intense, ultra-violent gunplay with fluid movement mechanics and a stylish combo system. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is extinct, players control a war machine named V1 as it descends into Hell in search of blood to power itself. With its over-the-top action, creative level design, and skill-based scoring system, ULTRAKILL has gained a strong following among fans of old-school shooters and modern action games alike.
